In this note, I put down what I missed when replicating the model to reproduce figure 1 in March (1991). When I first try to recreate the model, the figure I produced was different from that in March (1991). I refer to [Workiewicz's work](https://github.com/Mac13kW/March_1991_Original) to check what causes the discrepancies.

#### 1. Belief vs. code
In the article, belief generally refers to individual beliefs, and code to organization code. I failed to grasp this point at the beginning, hence some of my initial interpretations of the article were wrong. For example, “Specifically, if the code is 0 on a particular dimension, individual belief is not affected” (p. 74) means when the organization does not have preference over one particular dimension, individual beliefs in this dimension will not be adjusted due to socialization. I interpreted the sentence as when the individual has a belief value of 0, he/she will not update the belief. This is closely related to the second point. 

#### 2. Flip a coin when an individual has a belief value of 0
When an individual belief has a value of 0 over a certain dimension, it is assumed that the individual will flip a coin and decide what actions will he/she take, either -1 or 1. 0 is not an actionable item for the individual. This assumption has brought luck into the model. The individual may lack knowledge (holding belief of 0) but still perform well by taking the right action by chance. 

#### 3. Gradual change in individual beliefs
This point is not reflected clearly in the article. It is assumed that individuals will change their beliefs gradually with a probability of $$ p_1 $$. For a certain dimension, if an individual belief is -1, and the organization code is 1, the individual belief will change to 0, not directly to 1. The code developed by noted that this point is important: “Without it the results will look like Figure 1, but the values will not match exactly.”

#### 4. Organization will observe performance
The article mentioned this point briefly: “the code will be adjusted to conform to the dominant belief within the superior group” (p. 74). In other words, the organization will learn from the superior individuals only. Superior individuals are defined as those who perform better than the organization. The organization is assumed to be able to observe the performance of itself and all the individuals. However, as noted in point 2, some individuals will flip a coin and may perform better by luck, not by superior knowledge. The organization is not able to differentiate luck versus knowledge.

#### 5. Calculation of performance
In my first version, I calculated the performance as ``` mean(org == reality) ```. The replication calculated it as ```sum(org * reality)```. The difference is how to deal with the dimensions where the organization acts 0. In the former, holding 0 in the organization code is penalized. Since it is different from reality, the performance will be -1. In the latter, holding 0 in the organization code will lead to a performance of 0. Only when holding a code that is completely different from the reality will be penalized (e.g., the reality is 1, while the organization code is -1). 

#### 6. A note for simulation
Be careful of the differentiate between the number of simulations and the number of periods in each simulation. In each simulation, there could be tens of or even hundreds of periods. Mutual learning happens in each period. 


Many of the above points are related to the status of 0. What does 0 mean? It seems to be a middle ground for the organization, where it holds the neutral belief. It can be taken by the organization, and the organization will be punished less compared to taking a completely different action. But it cannot be taken by an individual. Individuals have to choose between 1 or -1, whether by their beliefs or by flipping a coin. It is difficult to come up with a practical meaning of 0.

#### Replication of figure 1

I also plot the average periods to reach equilibrium, which decreases along with the increase of either $$ p_1 $$ or $$ p_2 $$.
